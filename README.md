# feedmaterial
MeerK40t Extension to feed material (custom script)

This extension adds in a `feedmaterial` command which talks to an arduino device. It sends "Start" and then waits for the device to respond with "End". That is all. The rest of the script work is done by the arduino to feed material forward.
